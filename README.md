## InsurTech_classification

This reposity contains the following files:
  - Training and Test dataset with anonymized features that used for driving behavior classification
  - Individual time-series trip data corresponding to each data point in the training/test dataset for feature extractions
  - An notebook containing the machine learning pipeline prototype for this classification task 

The task is to build a Machine Learning pipeline for the classification. Included in the notebooks are:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Implementation of data cleaning and feature extraction based on EDA 
  - Modeling pipeline
  - Model validation and tuning 
  - Model intepretation
